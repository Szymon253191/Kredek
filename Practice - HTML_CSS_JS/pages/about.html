            Are you tired of working regular hours and receiving a boring paycheck? Do you crave the thrill of working
            overtime without getting paid fairly for it? Then Overtime Overlord Comp. is the company for you!<br><br>

            At Overtime Overlord, we specialize in underpaying our employees and making them work longer hours than
            legally allowed. But don't worry, we make up for it with our "fun" and "quirky" office environment. We've
            got a ping pong table, a water cooler that sometimes works, and a boss who loves telling dad jokes!<br><br>

            Not convinced yet? How about this - every month, we hold a competition for the employee who worked the most
            overtime! The winner gets a prize - a pat on the back from our CEO! And if you're lucky, you might get a
            bonus of $2 (subject to change based on our CEO's mood).<br><br>

            So what are you waiting for? Join the Overtime Overlord family today and say goodbye to fair pay and
            work-life balance forever!<br><br>
